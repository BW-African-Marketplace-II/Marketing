            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Informal cross-border trade is a major feature of African economies: it creates jobs, contributes to food and energy security, and alleviates poverty. However many traders are unaware of their rights, required customs procedures and documentation, making them vulnerable to corruption and harassment.</p>
